## Installation

1. install globally

```shell
pnpm add @angular/cli -g
```

2. install new project

```shell
ng new my-project --prefix pm
```

- `--prefix` is an optional property to add a prefix to all the selector directives in our components. In this case we changed the `app` prefix to `pm`(<pm-root></pm-root>)

3. answer the questions based on your needs
4. go the project folder, in this case `cd my-project`
5. start the app

```shell
npm start
```

### Commands

Here is some useful commands:

#### component

```shell
ng g c [path/component name]
```

- We can use `--flat` to create a component without folder.
- We can use `--skip-tests` to prevent generating testing file

#### Service

```shell
ng g s [path/service name]
```

#### add a module

We can use `add` to add an external library or module:

```shell
ng add [module name]
```

## keywords

### Decorator

Decorators are functions and by using them we can add metadata or directives and we use them to add something to our class, like `@Component()`,
so in this case we can tell Angular how it should run our component

```ts
@Component({
  selector: `pm-root`,
  template: `
    <div>
      <h1>{{ pageTitle }}</h1>
      <div>First Component</div>
    </div>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  pageTitle: string = "Hello World!";
}
```

### Directives

In fact, directives are HTML-like tags and we use them to create something custom or we can use the built-in directives like: `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`

### Interpolation

Is a way to execute js code inside HTML code and it's one way binding from component class property to an element property

### Property Binding & Template Expression

To bind a value (template expression is a property in our class and we can bind it to properties with quotes) to an element
property with putting the property name inside a bracket `[]`:

```angular
<img [src]="product.imageUrl" />
<img src="{{ product.imageUrl }}" />
<input type="text" [disabled]="isDisabled" />
<img src="http://myImages.org/{{ product.imageUrl }}" />
```

ðŸš© Generally **Interpolation** is used for return a value to HTML code and **Property Binding** is used for bind any type of value, like boolean, number, etc.

[Property Binding](https://angular.io/guide/property-binding)

[Property Binding Best Practice](https://angular.io/guide/property-binding-best-practices)

### Event Binding

It is used to bind an event from HTML to a method from the class and the event should put in the prentices `()`:

```ts
<button (click)="toggleImage()">Show Image</button>
```

ðŸš© methods should have () too.

[Event Binding](https://angular.io/guide/event-binding)

### Two way data binding

Generally, to use 2-way data binding we need something like `input`s, so first we need **Property Binding** to bind a value
from the class to the input and when user types, we want to fill that property with new value, so we need to call an event.
In that case, we should use **Event Binding**. In fact we should use `[()]` this form for 2-way data binding:

```ts
<input type="text" [(ngModel)]="listFilter"/>
```

[2-Way Data Binding](https://angular.io/guide/two-way-binding)

![Data Binding](/img/data_binding.jpg)

### Pipes

Angular has own `Data Transform` for data transformation built-in functions for `Date`, `Number`, `Decimal`, `Percent`, `Currency`, `JSON`, etc.

ðŸš© Generally, pipes are used for transforming data.

```ts
{{product.productCode | lowercase}}
<img [src]="product.imageUrl" [title]="product.productName | uppercase"/>
{{product.price | currency | lowercase}}
{{product.price | currency: "USD": "symbol": "1.2-2"}} // at least 1 number to the left of the decimal and 2 and only 2 numbers to the right of the decimal
```

So, we can use multiple pipes. Also there are some pipes with parameters: [Pipes](https://angular.io/api?type=pipe)

### get & set

In Angular by using `Getter` and `Setter` we can get the value or set a new value to a **private** property (the convention is to use `_` for private properties):

ðŸš© In fact, by using `Getter` and `Setter` we are trying to make our variable immutable.

```ts
private _amount: number = 0;

get amount(): number {
    return this._amount;
};
set amount(value: number) {
    this._amount = value;
}
```

ðŸš© Private property means, we want to use this variable inside the class and for outsiders we should use `Getter` and `Setter`.

### @Input()

It is a decorator to handle passed data from **`Parent`** component to the **`Child`** component using `Property Binding`:

```ts title="./src/app/star.component.ts"
export class StarComponent implements OnChanges {
  @Input() rating: number = 0;
  cropWidth: number = 75;

  ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges): void {
    this.cropWidth = (this.rating * 75) / 5;
  }
}
```

```ts title="./src/app/product-list.component.html"
    <td>
        <pm-star [rating]="product.starRating"></pm-star>
    </td>
```

[Inputs & Outputs](https://angular.io/guide/inputs-outputs)

### @Output()

By using this decorator, we can pass an event from **`Child`** to the **`Parent`** component by using `Event Binding`:

1. Create an event in the **`Child`** component with desired argument data type:

```ts
export class StarComponent implements OnChanges {
  // ...
  @Output() ratingClicked: EventEmitter<string> = new EventEmitter<string>();
  // ...
}
```

2. Using the event in a method to call it in the **`Child`** component HTML file:

```ts title="star.component.ts"
export class StarComponent implements OnChanges {
  // ...
  onClick(): void {
    this.ratingClicked.emit(`The rating ${this.rating} was clicked!`);
  }
  // ...
}
```

3. Bind the event in the **`Child`** component to the element:

```html title="star.component.html"
<div (click)="onClick()">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

4. Bind the new event (the name which we give the `@Output` in the child component) to the **`Parent`** component HTML file:

```html title="product-list.component.html"
<td>
  <pm-star
    [rating]="product.starRating"
    (ratingClicked)="onRatingClicked($event)"
  ></pm-star>
</td>
```

- The `onRatingClicked()` method should created in the **`Parent`** component.
- `$event` includes all the data that we passed with `this.ratingClicked.emit()` in the **`Child`** component.

5. Now we need to create the `onRatingClicked()` method in the **`Parent`** component.

```ts title="product-list.component.ts"
export class ProductListComponent implements OnInit {
  // ...
  onRatingClicked(message: string): void {
    this.pageTitle = `Product List: The message is: ${message}`;
  }
  // ...
}
```

### Dependency Injection

Sometimes we need to create a function or a piece of codes that is independent from the others and we can call it in any component.

#### Services

Service is a type of class that is independent.

- So we can create a service and Angular will make it `Singleton` (single instance of our service) and
  the `Injector` (is a tool to inject our services as a dependency to our classes) will inject our services in the class.
- Generally, we can inject our services in one component and its children or inject to the root and accessible through out the application:

1. Accessible for the components

```ts title="product.service.ts"
@Injectable({
  providedIn: "root",
})
export class ProductService {
  getProducts(): IProduct[] {
    // ...
  }
}
```

2. Accessible for a specific component and its children

```ts title="product-list.component.ts"
@Component({
  /* . . . */
  providers: [ProductService]
})
```

[Providers](https://angular.io/guide/providers)

[Dependency Injection](https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection)

3. Now we can inject and use our service as a dependency injection in the components:

```ts title="product-list.component.ts"
export class ProductListComponent implements OnInit {
  // ...
  constructor(private productService: ProductService) {}

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.products = this.productService.getProducts();
    this.filteredProducts = this.products;
  }
  // ...
}
```

### RxJs & Observable

`RxJs` (**Reactive Extensions**) is a library for mixin or composing data using observable sequences.

- Generally, `Observable` is just like `Promise()`, so we need to make our action `Observable`, otherwise, we can't `Subscribe`.
- `Observable` doesn't do anything until we `Subscribe` to something.
- After subscribe, we have 3 stages (In case of pressing keys by user):
  1. `Next`: We'll notify by each key on pressing.
  2. `Error`: If there is an error, we'll get it in this stage.
  3. `Complete`: After finishing the action, we'll notify by this stage.
- It has over 100 pipe that we can use when we are subscribing to something, e.g. `lowercase`, `uppercase`, etc.
- To cleanup the `subscription`, after the action, we need to `unsubscribe` the action.
- The convention for observable variable is to use `$` after the name of the variable.
- `<observable variable>.pipe(<pipe functions separated by (,)>).subscribe(<callback func>)`

```ts
import { Observable, range, map, filter } from "rxjs";

const source$: Observable<number> = range(0, 10);

source$
  .pipe(
    map((x) => x * 3),
    filter((x) => x % 2 === 0)
  )
  .subscribe((x) => console.log(x));
```

#### http

Usually, we use `Observable` to make a request to another source, to do so, we need to add `HttpClientModule` to the `app.modules.ts`
and inject `HttpClient` to our services:

```ts title="services/products.service.ts"
import { Observable, catchError, tap, throwError } from "rxjs";

export class ProductService {
  private productUrl = "api/products/products.json";

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  //? Get Products
  getProducts(): Observable<IProduct[]> {
    return this.http.get<IProduct[]>(this.productUrl).pipe(
      tap((data) => console.log(`All: ${JSON.stringify(data)}`)),
      catchError(this.handleError)
    );
  }
  //? Error handling
  private handleError(err: HttpErrorResponse) {
    let errMsg = "";

    if (err.error instanceof ErrorEvent)
      errMsg = `An error occurred: ${err.error.message}`;
    else
      errMsg = `Server returned code: ${err.status}, error message is: ${err.error.message}`;

    console.log(errMsg);
    return throwError(() => errMsg);
  }
}
```

`tap`: Is a pipe for showing not-streamed data. We can use it for logging or debugging. [tap](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/function/tap)
`catchError`: Is a pipe for catching errors, generally we need to return an error object observable with `throwError`. [catchError](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/function/catchError) --- [throwError](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/function/throwError)

Now we can `subscribe` our service to get the data:

```ts title="product-list.component.ts"
export class ProductListComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  //...
  errorMessage: string = "";
  sub?: Subscription;
  products: IProduct[] = [];
  filteredProducts: IProduct[] = [];
  //...

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.sub = this.productService.getProducts().subscribe({
      next: (products) => {
        this.products = products;
        this.filteredProducts = this.products;
      },
      error: (err) => (this.errorMessage = err),
      complete: () => console.log("Request has been done!"),
    });
  }
  ngOnDestroy(): void {
    this.sub?.unsubscribe();
  }
  //...
}
```

- Since this a http request, so the `next` function will execute once.
- Each service will return a subscription and we can use it for `unsubscribe` the request on unmount lifecycle.

### Lifecycle Hooks

[Lifecycle Hooks](https://angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks)

#### OnInit

We can initialize our component or retrieve data from backend in this lifecycle

#### onChanges

We can do something after change to input properties

#### onDestroy

We can prevent, or show a prompt to the user before leave the component or cleanup before destroy the component

- Generally, to use the `Lifecycle`s, we need to implement them in our `class`:

```ts
import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  // ...
})
export class ProductListComponent implements OnInit {
  //...
  ngOnInit(): void {
    console.log("On Init");
  }
}
```

### Custom Pipe

To create a `Custom Pipe` we need to create a `class` and use `@Pipe` decorator:

```ts title="src/app/pipes/convert-to-spaces.pipe.ts"
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from "@angular/core";

@Pipe({
  name: "convertToSpaces",
})
export class ConvertToSpacesPipe implements PipeTransform {
  /**
   * Convert any specified character to space
   * @param {string} value - Interpolation property
   * @param {string} character - The character that we want to be replaced
   */
  transform(value: string, character: string): string {
    return value.replace(character, " ");
  }
}
```

```html title="src/app/products/product-list.component.html"
<td>{{product.productCode | lowercase | convertToSpaces:"-"}}</td>
```

ðŸš© After creating our custom pipe, we need to add it to `declarations` in the `app.module.ts`

### Router

1. To use the router, we should add it to our `app.module.ts`:

```ts
@NgModule({
  declarations: [/*...*/],
  imports: [
    //...
    RouterModule.forRoot([
      {path: "products", component: ProductListComponent},
      {path: "products/:id", component: ProductDetailComponent}, // Route with path params
      {path: "welcome", component: WelcomeComponent},
      {path: "", redirectTo: "welcome", pathMatch: "full"}, // Exact math
      {path: "**", component: ProductListComponent},
    ])
  ],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
```

- Better to use a separate file for routing
- Better to right the more specific route at the beginning and less specific at the end. The order is matter!
- Better to remove the `selector` from those pages which we want to navigate to them with router.

2. Now we can pass `routerLink` as a directive to any HTML element and make it clickable:

```html title="components/layout/navbar.component.html"
<ul class="nav nav-pills">
  <li><a class="nav-link" routerLink="/welcome">Home</a></li>
  <li><a class="nav-link" routerLink="/products">Product List</a></li>
</ul>
```

3. If we want to pass a `path param` or a `query param`, we need to pass an array to `routerLink`:

```html title="pages/product-list.component.html"
<td>
  <a [routerLink]="['/products', product.productId]">{{product.productName}}</a>
</td>
```
4. Now by using `ActivatedRoute` dependency injection, we can get the `params`:
```ts title="pages/products/product-detail.component.ts"
constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) { }
```

5. Now for getting the params, we can use 2 different approach based on our needs:
    1. `Snapshot`: Read the parameter one time:
    ```ts
      this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get("id")
    ```
    2. `Observable`: Read the emitted parameters as they change:
    ```ts
      this.route.paramMap.subscribe(
        params => console.log(params.get("id"))
      )
    ```
    - the "id" must be matched to the `path: products/:id`

6. Now we need to show the selected route in the view by using `router-outlet`:

```ts title="app.component.html"
<div class="container">
  <router-outlet></router-outlet>
</div>
```

- The `base` tag in the `index.html` is very important for the routing.

## Tips

- Every component should add to `@NgModule()` in the `app.module.ts`
- Don't use `constructor` with codes which it has side-effects, like requests. Just use for initialization
- `Synchronous` is just like a **phone call**, it is a real-time action, you talk, immediately I respond.
- `Asynchronous` is like **email**, I send an email to you and don't wait for your respond and do another task.
- In `angular.json` file, we can modify the configuration like adding library's CSS or Js file or for example,
  we can change the assets directory:

```json
{
  "assets": ["src/favicon.ico", "src/assets", "src/api"]
}
```

### Errors

To check the errors in our app we can check this link
[Angular Errors](https://angular.io/errors)
