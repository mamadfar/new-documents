## Test types

1. `E2E`: Stands for `End To End` test. When we talk about e2e, means testing on a live and run app.
This kind of test uses for simulate user behavior on the live app. It tends to be less reliable.

2. `Unit testing`: Like testing a single class or function. In other word, isolation test and its independent piece of code.
In this type of test, we don't test the `template` file, we need to just test the `ts` file.

3. `Integration test`: When we want to test a few functions, classes or components which are connected 
to each other, we use this method. Generally it is more than a **Unit** and less than an **Application**.

    - `Shallow`: Just test a single component (ts and template html file)
    - `Deep`: Test the main component and its children.

## Mocking
Sometimes we need to mock our services or use a fake data instead of real data. We have 4 types of
mocking:

1. `Dummies`: Very simple object just to simulate a simple object (like dummy class, dummy dependency).
2. `Stubs`: An object which we can control its behavior, for example if we call a method in Stubs, we 
can decide what should the return value be.

3. `Spies`: Is an object which we can track which method is called and how many times called and what 
parameters is used.

4. `True mocks`: Is more complex and we can use it in very specific situation.

ðŸš© An object means a class, dependency, function, services, etc.

## Tools
1. `Karma`: Is a test runner on the browser
2. `Jasmine`: To create mocks and generally the tests

## Testing
For testing in Angular, we should have a file with `.spec.ts` extension.
```ts title="app/first-test.spec.ts"
describe('First Test', function () {
  let testVar: any;

  beforeEach(() => {
    testVar = {}
  });

  it('should return true if a is true', function () {
    //? Arrange
    testVar.a = false;

    //? Act
    testVar.a = true;

    //? Assertion
    expect(testVar.a).toBe(true);
  });
});
```
- In each test cases we have 3 sections:
    1. `Arrange`: When we should initialize our variable.
    2. `Act`: Change the value to expected value.
    3. `Assertion`: Check our data if it reaches our needs.
- `beforeEach`: This function will execute before every `it` or test cases
- We can use `test` instead of `it`.
- Convention for description for it is using `should` at the beginning of each test cases.
