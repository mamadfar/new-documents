## Test types

1. `E2E`: Stands for `End To End` test. When we talk about e2e, means testing on a live and run app.
   This kind of test uses for simulate user behavior on the live app. It tends to be less reliable.

2. `Unit testing`: Like testing a single class or function. In other word, isolation test and its independent piece of code.
   In this type of test, we don't test the `template` file, we need to just test the `ts` file.

![unit](/img/unit-testing.png)

3.  `Integration test`: When we want to test a few functions, classes or components which are connected
    to each other, we use this method. Generally it is more than a **Unit** and less than an **Application**.

        - `Shallow`: Just test a single component (ts and template html file)
        - `Deep`: Test the main component and its children.

## Mocking

Sometimes we need to mock our services or use a fake data instead of real data. We have 4 types of
mocking:

1. `Dummies`: Very simple object just to simulate a simple object (like dummy class, dummy dependency).
2. `Stubs`: An object which we can control its behavior, for example if we call a method in Stubs, we
   can decide what should the return value be.

3. `Spies`: Is an object which we can track which method is called and how many times called and what
   parameters is used.

4. `True mocks`: Is more complex and we can use it in very specific situation.

ðŸš© An object means a class, dependency, function, services, etc.

## Tools

1. `Karma`: Is a test runner on the browser
2. `Jasmine`: To create mocks and generally the tests

## Testing

### Simple test

For testing in Angular, we should have a file with `.spec.ts` extension.

```ts title="app/first-test.spec.ts"
describe("First Test", function () {
  let testVar: any;

  beforeEach(() => {
    testVar = {};
  });

  it("should return true if a is true", function () {
    //? Arrange
    testVar.a = false;

    //? Act
    testVar.a = true;

    //? Assertion
    expect(testVar.a).toBe(true);
  });
  it("should pending", function () {
    pending("For later");
  });
  xit("should disabled", function () {});
  it("should fail", function () {
    fail("Fail test");
  });
});
```

- In each test cases we have 3 sections:
  1. `Arrange`: When we should initialize our variable.
  2. `Act`: Change the value to expected value.
  3. `Assertion`: Check our data if it reaches our needs.
- `beforeEach`: This function will execute before every `it` or test cases
- We can use `test` instead of `it`.
- Convention for description for it is using `should` at the beginning of each test cases.
- `pending()`: By using this function we can specify that, this test is not completed yet
  and `Karma` will show it with yellow color. Also, we can pass a parameter to show a message in `Karma`

- `xit`: Means we want to temporary disable this test.
- `fail()`: We can manually fail our test, to check the test case. Also, we can pass a param as a message.

### Services
For services we need to instantiate the service and call the methods to order to use them.
```ts title="calculator.service.ts"
export class CalculatorService {
  add(n1: number, n2: number) {
    let result = n1 + n2;
    return result;
  }
  subtract(n1: number, n2: number) {
    let result = n1 - n2;
    return result;
  }
}
```
```ts title="calculator.service.spec.ts"
describe("CalculatorService", function () {
  it("should add two numbers", function () {
    const calculator = new CalculatorService();
    let result = calculator.add(2, 2);
    expect(result).toBe(4);
  });
  it("should subtract two numbers", function () {
    let calculator = new CalculatorService();
    let result = calculator.subtract(2, 2);
    expect(result).toBe(0);
  });
});
```
